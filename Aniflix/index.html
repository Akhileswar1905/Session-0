        <h1>Haikyuu</h1>
        <p>
          Junior high school student, Shoyo Hinata, becomes obsessed with
          volleyball after catching a glimpse of Karasuno High School playing in
          Nationals on TV. Of short stature himself, Hinata is inspired by a
          player the commentators nickname 'The Little Giant', Karasuno's short
          but talented wing spiker. Though inexperienced, Hinata is athletic and
          has an impressive vertical jump. He joins his school's volleyball club
          – only to find he is its sole member, forcing him to spend the next
          two years trying to convince other students to help him practice. In
          the third and final year of junior high, some of Hinata's friends
          agree to join the club so he can compete in a tournament. In his first
          official game ever, they suffer a crushing defeat to the team favored
          to win the tournament – that included third-year Tobio Kageyama, a
          prodigy setter nicknamed 'The King of the Court' for both his skill
          and his brutal play style. The two spark a short rivalry, and after
          the game, Hinata vows to defeat Kageyama in high school.
